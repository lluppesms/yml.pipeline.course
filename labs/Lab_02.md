# Lab 2: Creating a YML Pipeline with parameters

In this lab we will create the a YML pipeline that uses user supplied parameters to deploy resources.

Review the [02-pipeline-with-parms.yml](../.azdo/pipelines/02-pipeline-with-parms.yml) file, noting the new parameters section at the top of the file.

Deploy the [02-pipeline-with-parms.yml](../.azdo/pipelines/02-pipeline-with-parms.yml) using the steps in [Deploy a YML Pipeline](./CreateNewPipeline.md), which are the same as the first 7 steps used in Lab 1.

The pipeline can now be run and it should ask you for a storage account name.
